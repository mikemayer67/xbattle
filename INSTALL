XBATTLE 6.0.1 INSTALLATION

To compile xbattle, take one of these two approaches.

  If you have "xmkmf" on your system:
    (1) Edit IMakefile to ...
            set DEFAULT_XBO_DIR to default option file directory 
            set DEFAULT_XBT_DIR to default load/edit file directory 
            set DEFAULT_XBA_DIR to default replay file directory 
    (2) Type "xmkmf"
    (3) Type "make"

  If you do not have "xmkmf" on your system:
    (1) Type "cp makefile.std makefile"
    (2) Edit makefile to ...
            accomodate your system includes and/or libraries
            set DEFAULT_XBO_DIR to default option file directory 
            set DEFAULT_XBT_DIR to default load/edit file directory 
            set DEFAULT_XBA_DIR to default replay file directory 
    (3) Type "make"

Once xbattle has been compiled ...

  If you want xbattle to always use a default file:
    (1) Edit xbattle.dot as appropriate
    (2) Type "cp xbattle.dot ~your_login/.xbattle"

  If you want to set up the xbattle man page, and you have root privileges:
    (1) Copy xbattle.man to games/demos man directory (usually /usr/man/man6)
           Type "cp xbattle.man /usr/man/man6/xbattle.6"
    (2) Update the abbreviated man page index.  On most systems:
           Type "catman -w"
        Alternatively, you can always use "man -F xbattle", which will
        force man to explicitly search for the man page.

  If you want to set up the xbattle man page, and you aren't root:
    (1) Copy xbattle.man to your personal man directory
    (2) Make sure your personal man directory is listed in your MANPATH
    (3) Update man page index (see above) or access with "man -F xbattle"
